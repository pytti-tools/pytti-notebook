# PyTTI-Tools: Easy Mode Notebooks

PyTTI can do a lot. This is a double edged sword, and the sheer number of settings
can be intimidating to both new and veteran users alike. 

This folder contains self-contained notebooks with interfaces designed not to overwhelm the user with
options. Expect notebooks here to use sane defaults and to limit how many different 
knobs and switches will be available to you.
